<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I hail from and spent the entirety of my formative years in the NW Iowa farm town of Spencer. Known to many as the jewel
 of Northwestern Iowa Spencer is acclaimed far and wide for its supremacy in farmland, open spaces, friendly people,
 wind power generation, and as a pipeline of management information systems talent to The University of Iowa.  
 As a youngster I flourished as an integral member of Spencer's high school football team.  My job was to lure an
 unsuspecting defensive back away from the center of the field and towards the sideline. Once I accomplished this 
 feat I would first confirm with the referee that I was indeed onsides and then I would proceed to block the surprised
 defender as the running back ran the ball to the left or right of the center. I spent eighteen years and two months in
 the green pastures of Spencer before voluntarily relocating to Iowa City Iowa to enroll in The University of Iowa. 
 The University of Iowa, which of course I'm sure you are all aware, is known for its sobriety, chastity, and its 
 numerous men's volleyball championships. I was right at home. After several days of attending classes at Iowa I
 blossomed into a stellar student and became the man that I am today.</p>

<h3>More about me</h3>
<p>I enjoy hunting, fishing, skiing, golfing, boating, and swimming. I am a senior business analytics information systems
 major with an emphasis in management information systems. Upon graduating this May I hope to find a job doing absolutely
 anything that will provide me with monetary compensation. I do, however, hope to secure a position that is in line with
 my major area of study as I have grown partial to it. If you would like to know anything more about me or need to get 
 ahold of me for class feel free to call, text, email, or shout. I look forward to taking classes with you all this spring
 semester and getting to know you.</p>
